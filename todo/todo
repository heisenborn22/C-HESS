Remaining things to do:
- checkmate logic (Partially done)
- refactor the memory management code
- add some more commands
- polish the user interface ( ##-------- 20% done)
- fix server-client communication bugs (app works fine if both parts "behave well", but error handling is not implemented efficiently).
